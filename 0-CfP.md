# Call for Papers
We invite submissions exploring the synergy between scaling predictive methods and causal modeling to build the next generation of trustworthy and reliable AI.

## Topics
Particular interest in papers that interface and provide bridges between topics in AI scaling and causality. Other potential topics include, but are not limited to:
1. Emergence of causal abilities in foundation models (or the failure thereof)
2. OOD generalization and robustness of large models
3. Scaling and accelerating inference in causal generative models 
4. Counterfactual and logical reasoning 
5. Causal modeling and reasoning in large models
6. Design of interactive causal world models
7. Trustworthy and interpretable AI
8. Evaluation and benchmarking (and the limitations thereof)

## Submission and Format
We invite submissions of short papers presenting recent work on scaling and causality. Submissions will be handled via OpenReview. The submission link will be announced soon.

Submissions should be formatted using the AISTATS LaTeX style. Papers are limited to 4 pages (excluding references). The review process will be double-blind. Accepted contributions will be presented as posters during the workshop. We will select a small number of contributed talks from the accepted submissions for short oral presentations at the workshop.

Submissions under review or accepted within the past year at other venues are allowed. All accepted papers are non-archival and will be made publicly available on OpenReview.
